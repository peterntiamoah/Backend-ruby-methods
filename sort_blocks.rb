#The ruby array sort method can use a block to sort various arrays.  
#The block must compare between two elements of the array, a and b.  
#If a<b, it should evaluate to -1.  
#If a==b, it should evaluate to 0.  
#And if a>b, it should evaluate to 1. 
#Here is the start of a program, which you should call sort_blocks.rb.

#Note the use of the spaceship operator <=>.  
#It does what the commented out lines do, but on one line.

#Add to this program. 
#Add additional calls to book_array.sort that pass blocks.  
#For your first call to sort, pass a block so that the array is sorted in order of title, and print out the array.  
#For your second call to sort, pass a block so that the array is sorted in order of copies, and print out the array.
